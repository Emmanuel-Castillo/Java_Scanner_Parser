PLC Project (Scanner/Parser) by Emmanuel Castillo

ID: 1827122

IDE: Visual Studio Code 

Program Language: Java

Input: When running on the command terminal, compile the "PLCTermProject.java" file. Afterwards, run the .class file alongside any of the input test files. For example,

javac PLCTermProject.java
java PLCTermProject input1.txt
java PLCTermProject input2.txt

...and so on.

Output: The program will output the trace of the parse tree given the grammar inside the input file. This will produce standard output on the terminal and it is not saved on an output file.
